# 0x01. Python - Async

## Project Overview
This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python, exploring the concepts of `async` and `await` syntax, asynchronous I/O, and running concurrent coroutines. By the end of the project, you should be able to efficiently run asynchronous programs and handle concurrent tasks using Python's `asyncio` module.

## Resources

- [Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/)
- [asyncio - Asynchronous I/O](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
- [random.uniform](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.uniform)

## Learning Objectives

- `async` and `await` syntax
- How to execute an async program with `asyncio`
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create `asyncio` tasks
- How to use the `random` module in asynchronous code
