# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

## Python | Back-end | Advanced Python

### Concepts
This project focuses on the following concepts:

- Type Annotations in Python 3
- Using Type Annotations for Function Signatures and Variable Types
- Duck Typing
- Code Validation with MyPy

---

## Resources

### Read or Watch:
- [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet.html)

---

## Learning Objectives

### General

- **Type Annotations in Python 3**: Understanding how to use type annotations to specify variable types and function signatures in Python 3.
- **Duck Typing**: Understanding the concept of duck typing, where the type of an object is determined by its behavior rather than its class.
- **Using Type Annotations for Functions and Variables**: Knowing how to apply type annotations for functions and variables to improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Validating Code with MyPy**: Learning how to use MyPy to validate that your Python code follows the expected type annotations and catches potential type errors.

## Project Details

This project introduces variable annotations and teaches how to apply them in Python 3. You will work with type hints, annotations for functions, and variables, while exploring how to improve your code's correctness by utilizing MyPy for type checking.

## How to Validate Your Code with Mypy

1. Install MyPy via pip:
   ```
   pip install mypy
   ```

2. Run MyPy on your Python files:
    ```
    mypy <filename>.py
    ```
