# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

## Python | Back-end

### Project Overview
This project focuses on Python asynchronous comprehension and generators, introducing key concepts for handling asynchronous operations in a more efficient and readable way.

---

### Resources
Here are some useful materials for reference:

- [PEP 530 – Asynchronous Comprehensions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0530/)
- [What’s New in Python: Asynchronous Comprehensions / Generators](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#pep-530-asynchronous-comprehensions)
- [Type-hints for generators](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generator)

### Learning Objectives

- **Write an asynchronous generator**  
  Understand how to create and work with generators that can asynchronously produce values in Python.

- **Use async comprehensions**  
  Learn to efficiently process data from asynchronous iterators using comprehensions, enabling cleaner and more readable code.

- **Type-annotate generators**  
  Apply type-hinting to asynchronous generators to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability.
